  @Summary:
    This is the Interrupt Manager file generated using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description:
    This header file provides implementations for global interrupt handling.
    For individual peripheral handlers please see the peripheral driver for
    all modules selected in the GUI.
